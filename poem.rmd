## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:    
All mimsy were the borogoves,   
      And the mome raths outgrabe.    

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!   

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,    
And sorry I could not travel both   
And be one traveler, long I stood   
And looked down one as far as I could   
To where it bent in the undergrowth;    

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,    
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make    
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was    
      The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,   
      Because she thought the sun   
Had got no business to be there   
      After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
      "To come and spoil the fun."    

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In shadows cast by twilight's hue,    
A poet's heart seeks something new,   
Whispered dreams within my mind,    
These verses, woven, intertwined.   

From depths of solitude I rise,   
To paint my thoughts across the skies,      
In words, my soul finds sweet release,    
A symphony of thoughts find peace.    

With pen in hand, I gently write,   
The rhythm flows, like birds in flight,   
And as the ink spills on the page,    
Emotions dance in every stage.    

Within these lines, my heart unveils,   
The joy, the sorrow, all the tales,   
Of love that blooms and love that fades,    
Of sunshine kissed and moonlight shades.    

Each word a brushstroke, vivid, bold,   
A tapestry of stories told,   
Of longing, hope, and whispered prayers,    
A poet's soul laid bare, aware.   

From line to line, the verses grow,   
Like rivers on their path to flow,    
I paint a world with words divine,    
A sanctuary, a sacred shrine.   

The stanzas dance, they gently sway,    
In melodies that gently play,   
And as the poem finds its voice,    
My spirit soars, my soul rejoices.    

For in these lines, I find my truth,    
A canvas where I find my youth,   
And with each word that I bestow,   
A piece of me, forever grows.   

So let me write, let verses flow,   
From depths within, my essence shows,   
In this poetic symphony,    
I find my voice, forever free.
